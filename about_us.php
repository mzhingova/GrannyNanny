<h1>WHY THE ‘ABOUT US’ PAGE ROCKS:</h1>

<p>
<a href="javascript:toggleElement('a1')">1.It tells us a story.</a>
</p>
<div id="a1" style="display:none">
Every company has a story to tell, so break out your storytelling
skills from that random English class you took years
ago and put them to work on your ‘About Us’ page. Using
descriptive and emotive copy, an ‘About Us’ page with a
story works harder for your business than a generic one.<br><br>
</div>
<p>
<a href="javascript:toggleElement('a2')">2.It shows some personality.</a>
</p>
<div id="a2" style="display:none">
For your ‘About Us’ page, you don’t need to pretend to be a
comedian if that isn’t part of your brand’s personality. Find
another aspect of your brand’s personality to showcase and
make a lasting impression by being yourself.<br><br>
</div>
<p>
<a href="javascript:toggleElement('a3')">3.It’s human.</a>
</p>
<div id="a3" style="display:none">
When you’re whipping up your ‘About Us’ page, make sure
to avoid industry jargon and instead use your authentic voice
to describe your product or service. Sure, it needs to be polished
and free of errors, but it should always sound friendly
and real.<br><br>
</div>
<p>
<a href="javascript:toggleElement('a4')">4.It lets customers do the talking.</a>
</p>
<div id="a4" style="display:none">
Personal testimonials build credibility and trust, which is
why they have a natural home on your ‘About Us’ page. If
you have a customer who has nothing but good things to say
about your company, why not hand them the mic and let
them do the talking?<br><br>
</div>
<p>
<a href="javascript:toggleElement('a5')">5.It skips the business babble.</a>
</p>
<div id="a5" style="display:none">
The moral of the story here is that you should try to get
rid of jargon on your ‘About Us’ page whenever possible.
Show your smarts through simple copy -- not business
babble<br><br>
